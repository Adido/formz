{"body":"## Formz\r\n\r\nformz is a Form building extra that allows you to get forms up and running on your website.\r\nYou can store the information inside the database or send a email and store in database.\r\n\r\n## How to Export\r\n\r\nFirst, clone this repository somewhere on your development machine:\r\n\r\n`git clone http://github.com/silentworks/formz.git ./`\r\n\r\nThen, create the target directory where you want to create the file.\r\n\r\nThen, navigate to the directory formz is now in, and do this:\r\n\r\n`git archive HEAD | (cd /path/where/I/want/my/new/repo/ && tar -xvf -)`\r\n\r\n(Windows users can just do git archive HEAD and extract the tar file to wherever\r\nthey want.)\r\n\r\nThen you can git init or whatever in that directory, and your files will be located\r\nthere!\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nNow, you can create some System Settings:\r\n\r\n- 'formz.core_path' - Point to /path/to/formz/core/components/formz/\r\n- 'formz.assets_url' - /path/to/formz/assets/components/formz/\r\n\r\nThen clear the cache. This will tell the Extra to look for the files located\r\nin these directories, allowing you to develop outside of the MODx webroot!\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nInstall using Manager Package Management\r\n\r\nFormIt <http://modx.com/extras/package/formit>\r\n\r\nFormItFastPack <http://modx.com/extras/package/formitfastpack>\r\n\r\n## Installing From Package\r\n\r\nIf you are installing from the package provided inside the packages directory, just copy the file into your\r\nMODX core/packages directory and then do find file locally inside of your Manager Package Management interface.\r\n\r\nOnce the package is installed you can setup a template variable and assign the __formz__ input type and output type to it.\r\nGo to a page that has the template variable assigned to its template, and you should now have an empty dropdown menu.\r\n\r\nYou can now start to create Forms by going to the components menu __Formz Builder__.\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\nAny comments or issues please raise that using the ticketing system, do remember this Extra is still in its early stages.\r\nI would not recommend using on a live site if the Extra is still in alpha.\r\n","tagline":"Form Builder extra for MODX Revolution","note":"Don't delete this file!
